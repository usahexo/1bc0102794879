#  Pharaoh Baccarat is a casino game where you can bet on the outcome of a hand of cards. What are the different betting options available in Pharaoh Baccarat? 

In Pharaoh Baccarat, the player can bet on one of three outcomes: Player, Banker, or Tie. The Player bet wins if the player's cards total more than the banker's cards, the Banker bet wins if the banker's cards total more than the player's cards, and the Tie bet is a bet that the two hands will tie.

#  What are the basic rules of Pharaoh Baccarat? 

When playing Pharaoh Baccarat, there are a few basic rules that players need to follow in order to maximize their chances of winning. These include understanding how the game works, betting correctly, and knowing when to fold.

In Pharaoh Baccarat, there are two hands dealt – the banker hand and the player hand. The aim of the game is to beat the banker's hand by either getting a higher value card, or making a bet on the player hand which is lower than the banker's hand total. In order to win, players need to get as close to 9 as possible.

Players can bet on either hand, and can also bet on a Tie which pays out at 8:1. However, it's important to remember that players can only bet once per turn, so they need to make sure they are betting strategically in order to increase their chances of winning.

One thing to keep in mind when playing Pharaoh Baccarat is that unlike traditional baccarat games, the ace counts as 1 in this version – so players need to be aware of this when making their bets.

Overall, Pharaoh Baccarat is a fun and easy game to play that offers plenty of opportunity for strategic betting. By following these simple rules, players can give themselves the best chance of winning big!

#  How do you decide who wins a hand in Pharaoh Baccarat? 

In Pharaoh Baccarat, bets are placed on the player, banker, or tie. The goal of the game is to have a hand value closer to 9 than the opponent. The betting process is simple - you either bet on the player or bank and then the dealer deals two cards face up to each player and one face down (the banker's card). 

The Ace is worth 1 point, 2-9 are worth face value, and 10-King are worth 0 points. If your first two cards add up to 10 points or more (e.g. an Ace and 9), then the value is automatically reduced to 0 points. In our example, the hand would be 6 (Ace+6) not 16 (Ace+10). 

The player's score is added to the banker's score and if this number is higher than 9 then the digit in excess of 9 is dropped e.g. 18 would be written as 8). The hand with the lower total is announced as the winner. So if Player has 2 and Banker has 3, then Banker would win because 3 is lower than 2+3=5. 

If both hands have the same value, this is called a "push" and your stake will be returned to you. In some online casinos, a "tie" pays out at 8:1 while others may payout at 5:1 or even 1:1 - so always check before you start playing! 

That's all there is to it! The aim of Pharaoh Baccarat is simple - get as close as possible to 9 using two cards. There are different rules for drawing cards depending on whether you're playing as the player or banker - but these are outlined above. Good luck!

#  In what ways can you winnings in Pharaoh Baccarat? 

When playing Pharaoh Baccarat, you are primarily competing against the dealer rather than other players. Your objective is to draw cards that total nine or as close to nine as possible. The following are some of the ways you can winnings in Pharaoh Baccarat.

One way to earn winnings is by having a natural nine. This occurs when you are dealt two cards that total nine without any taking into consideration the value of the ace. If the dealer has a natural nine, then the game is a tie.

Another way to earn winnings is if your third card gives you a total ofnine or less. For example, if you are initially dealt an eight and a two, your total would be ten. However, if you draw a three, then your new total would be six which falls within the range of nine or less. In this instance, you would earn winnings because your hand is closer to nine than the dealer’s hand. 

If neither you nor the dealer have a natural nine and the value of your third card is between zero and four inclusive, then you would stand pat. This means that no additional cards will be drawn for either player. If the value of your third card is five or six inclusive, then you would take one additional card; if the value of your third card is seven or eight inclusive, then you would take two additional cards.

If either you or the dealer has a natural nine with their first two cards, then all other bets are lost except for ties which pay off at eight-to-one odds. If both players have identical hands, such as two nines or two eights, then it is considered a push and all bets are returned to players
