#  Mystery As to Location of Sycuan Casino Bus Roulette Game 

For years, a group of friends have enjoyed playing bus roulette on their way to Sycuan Casino. The game is simple: each player puts $20 into the pot and draws a card. The ace is worth $100, face cards are worth $10, and all other cards are worth face value. The player with the highest card takes the pot.

The game has been played at various locations over the years, but no one seems to know where it will happen next. Suddenly, last weekend, the group was surprised when their bus pulled up to Sycuan Casino and they were informed that there was no room for them to play their game.

A casino spokesperson said that they had never heard of the game and that it was not authorized by the casino. The spokesperson added that anyone caught playing the game could be banned from the casino.

The mystery as to where the game will take place next has created speculation among the group of friends. Some believe that it may have been moved to another casino, while others think that it may have been cancelled altogether. Only time will tell.

#  Puzzling as to Where Sycuan Casino Bus Roulette Game is Located 

Most gamblers who enjoy playing casino bus roulette games don’t realize there is more than one place to do it. That’s because the Sycuan Casino, east of San Diego, California, has been the only tribal casino in Southern California to offer the game until recently. The Soboba Casino, about 60 miles away from Sycuan, began offering the game in its card room a few months ago.

The two casinos are about equidistant from Los Angeles. Sycuan is about 120 miles from downtown L.A., and Soboba is about 130 miles away. But that’s where the similarity ends. Because of California’s strict gambling regulations, each casino has adopted a different version of bus roulette, giving players at both casinos somewhat different experiences.

At Sycuan, six buses are parked on a section of the casino floor that has been cordoned off for the game. About two-thirds of the buses are occupied by players at any given time, with dealers and pit bosses circulating among them to take bets and oversee play. 

At Soboba, there are only three buses, and they are not parked on the floor. Instead, they sit in an open area next to the card room, where players can walk up and board them whenever they want to play. There are no dealers or pit bosses; players simply put their money into a pot on the bus and start playing.

The games at both casinos use a double-zero wheel, which gives players a slightly higher house edge than versions of the game with a single zero wheel. At Sycuan, the house edge is 2.76%, while it’s 2.88% at Soboba.

#  LOCATION OF SYCUAN CASINO BUS ROULETTE GAME REMAINS A MYSTERY

The Sycuan Casino bus roulette game has been around for years, but the location of the game has never been revealed to the public. Some believe that the game is played on a private lot near the casino, while others think that it may be taking place in a different city altogether.

In order to try and finally solve the mystery, I reached out to some of the regulars who play in the game. Many were happy to share their thoughts and theories on where the game is located, but nobody could give me a definitive answer.

One player told me that he believes it's being played at a lot near the casino because he's seen someone from security there before. Another player said that he's heard the game is being played in Santee, which is about 30 minutes away from Sycuan Casino.

At this point, it's anyone's guess as to where the game is actually taking place. I'll continue to reach out to players and try to get some more information, but for now, we'll just have to wait and see.
