#  Delaware Sports Betting Starts Monday

It’s been a long time coming, but legalized sports betting finally arrives in Delaware on Monday. The First State is one of four to offer single game wagering (New Jersey, West Virginia, and Nevada are the others) and the first to do so since the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May.

Delawareans have eagerly anticipated the return of legal sports betting, with lines forming outside of casinos in anticipation of Monday’s launch. Bettors will be able to place bets on NFL, college football, MLB, NBA, NCAA basketball, and hockey games.

One of the big questions for Delaware is how much revenue legalized sports betting will generate. A bill passed by the state legislature predicts that sports betting will account for $9 million in annual revenue, with $3 million of that going to the state government. That number could be significantly higher if bettors flock to Delaware’s casinos as expected.

The industry is off to a good start in New Jersey, which launched its sports betting market in June. In its first month of operation, New Jersey generated nearly $3 million in revenue from sports betting. That number is likely to grow as football season ramps up and more people begin betting on games.

Legalized sports betting has also been a boon for Nevada casinos. In fiscal year 2018, Nevada casinos generated $248 million in revenue from sports betting – an all-time high. That number is only expected to grow as more states legalize sports betting.

There are some concerns that legalized sports betting could lead to increased gambling addiction rates nationwide. However, there is no evidence yet that this is the case. In fact, a study conducted by Oxford Economics found that legalized sports betting would create only 1,600 new problem gamblers nationwide – a tiny fraction of the population.

There are also concerns that traditional bookmakers will be hurt by legalized sports betting. However, most bookmakers have already embraced the new reality and are offering online and mobile platforms where people can bet on games.

Legalized sports betting offers a new source of revenue for states and casinos while also giving bettors a convenient way to place wagers on their favorite teams. It remains to be seen how much money it will generate in Delaware, but early indications are that it will be a big success.

# ! Get Ready To Start Betting On Your Favorite Teams This Week

The NFL has now reached week 6 and things are starting to heat up. The odds makers have released the week 6 betting lines and people around the United States are getting ready to make their bets. This article is going to give you a few tips on how to make the most money possible when betting on the NFL.

First, let’s take a look at the week 6 betting lines for the Thursday night game. The Chicago Bears are 3 point favorites over the Miami Dolphins. This line seems about right, as the Bears have been playing fairly well this season and the Dolphins have not. I would recommend taking the Bears in this game.

The New Orleans Saints are 5 point favorites over the Baltimore Ravens. This line seems about right as well. The Saints have been one of the best teams in the NFL this season while the Ravens have been struggling. I would recommend taking the Saints in this game.

Now let’s take a look at some of the Sunday games. The Arizona Cardinals are 2 point favorites over the San Francisco 49ers. This line seems a little bit high, as the Cardinals have not been playing very well this season while the 49ers have been playing better than expected. I would recommend taking the 49ers in this game.

The Carolina Panthers are 7 point favorites over the Cincinnati Bengals. This line seems about right, as Carolina has been one of the best teams in football this year while Cincinnati has not been playing very well. I would recommend taking Carolina in this game.

The Dallas Cowboys are 3 point favorites over Washington Redskins. This line also seems about right, as Dallas has been one of the best teams in football while Washington has not played as well as expected so far this year. I would recommend taking Dallas in this game.

The Indianapolis Colts are 2 point favorites over Houston Texans. This line also seems about right, as both teams have been fairly inconsistent this season with Houston having a slight edge overall. I would recommend taking Indianapolis in this game.

#  Delaware's First Official Sports Betting Operation Will Open Up This Week

Delaware will soon have its first official sports betting operation, as the state Lottery announced that the new venture will open for business on Wednesday.

The new sports betting operation will be located at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, and it will offer both in-person and online betting options. The variety of bets that can be placed will include traditional favorites such as football and basketball, as well as unconventional bets such as MMA and e-sports.

In order to place a bet, players must be 21 years of age or older and must physically be in Delaware. Online betting is available to players outside of Delaware.

The Dover Downs Hotel & Casino is one of three sites that was approved by the state Lottery to offer sports betting. The other two sites are the Harrington Raceway & Casino and the Delaware Park Racetrack & Slots.

Sports betting has been legal in Delaware since 2009, when the state legislature passed a bill allowing horseracing tracks in the state to offer wagering on NFL games. However, this is the first time that full-fledged sports betting operations will be offered to the general public.

#  Delaware's New Sports Betting Operation Is Set To Open This Week

TheState of Delaware is getting ready to open up its sports betting operation this week. There are already a couple of sports betting facilities in operation in the state, and they have been doing well so far. The new sports betting operation is set to open on Thursday at the Harrington Raceway and Casino. It will be located in the former dog racing area, and it will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to midnight on weekends.

People in Delaware have been able to place bets on sports through out-of-state operations for quite some time now, but this will be the first time that they will be able to do so through a local facility. The new operation is expected to bring in a lot of business, and it is likely that other casinos in the state will start offering sports betting as well in order to compete.

So far, there has been a lot of interest in the new sports betting operation. In fact, officials with the Harrington Raceway and Casino say that they have been getting calls from people all over the country who are interested in placing bets on sports games. Some of these people are even said to be coming into the state specifically to place bets at the new casino.

There are already a number of states that offer legal sports betting, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. It seems likely that more states will begin to offer this type of gambling in the near future, as it becomes more popular.

#  Delaware's Sports Betting Operation Officially Opens Up This Week

Delaware is the first state to offer legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May. The state's three casinos will start taking bets on Thursday, and officials are expecting a total of $184 million in wagers this year.

Governor John Carney was among the first to place a bet, betting $10 on the Philadelphia Phillies to beat the Miami Marlins. "I may be out of luck on that one," he said.

Other states are expected to follow Delaware's lead, and industry analysts say that legalized sports betting could be worth as much as $6 billion annually.

There has been some concern that the legalization of sports betting could lead to more gambling addiction, but officials insist that there are safeguards in place to prevent abuse. "We have been paying attention to what has been going on in other states," said Robin Lippincott of the Delaware Council on Gambling Problems.

She said that while there is always a risk of addiction with any form of gambling, there are ways to limit those risks, such as self-exclusion programs and help lines. "There is always going to be something new for people to become addicted to," she said. "But we have a lot of experience in Delaware in dealing with addiction."

The Dover Downs casino will offer betting on NFL games, Major League Baseball games, NBA games, and NCAA basketball games, among others.
