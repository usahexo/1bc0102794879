#  How I Won My First DFS Tournament by Utilizing a Solid Strategy

I am not a professional DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) player by any means, but I have had some success playing in smaller tournaments. Earlier this year, I decided to put together a solid strategy and give it a shot in one of the larger tournaments on one of the major DFS sites. The tournament had a $100 entry fee and a prize pool of $10,000.

Since this was my first attempt at playing in one of these larger tournaments, I did some research to come up with what I felt was a solid strategy. After reading about various strategies, I settled on a couple of core concepts that I felt would work well for me.

The first concept was to target players who were in good matchups. This can be done by looking at the team's defensive stats (e.g. points allowed per game) as well as the individual player's stats (e.g. how many points they average per game).

The second concept was to make sure that I had at least a couple of players from each team in my lineup. This would help to ensure that I had exposure to as many potential points as possible.

Putting these two concepts together, here is an example lineup that I might have used in the tournament mentioned earlier:

QB: Tom Brady (NE) - vs HOU ($8,500)

RB: Lamar Miller (HOU) - @ NE ($7,100)

RB: Jay Ajayi (MIA) - vs CLE ($6,000)

WR: Antonio Brown (PIT) - vs NYJ ($9,300)

WR: Brandin Cooks (NO) - @ ATL ($7,400)

TE: Rob Gronkowski (NE) - vs HOU ($8,200)


DST: Miami Dolphins (@CLE - $2,600)

With this lineup, I was targeting players who were in good matchups and also had high potential point totals. For example, Tom Brady is always a safe bet given his history of success and the matchup against Houston's defense. Antonio Brown is another player who is always a threat to put up big numbers and he was facing the Jets' weak defense. Finally, Rob Gronkowski is always a great option at tight end since he is so touchdown-dependent. Against Houston's defense, he had a high potential for points.

#  The Gambler's Guide to Winning at Double Down Casino

In order to be a successful gambler at Double Down Casino, you need to know the basics of the game. The following guide will teach you how to play and give you some tips on how to win.

## Introduction

Double Down Casino is a popular online casino game that can be played on your computer or mobile device. The object of the game is to match as many of the cards in your hand as possible with the cards shown on the table. The player then has the option to "double down" and bet their current wager on their hand. If they match all of the cards, they win double their original wager.

There are a few basic things that you need to know in order to play Double Down Casino:

- The player is dealt two cards initially, and each card has a point value. Face cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks) are worth 10 points each, while other cards are worth their face value. An Ace can be valued as either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is advantageous for the player.

- The goal of the game is to match as many of the cards in your hand as possible with the cards shown on the table. The player then has the option to "double down" and bet their current wager on their hand.

- If the player matches all of the cards in their hand, they win double their original wager. If they exceed 21 points (or "bust"), they lose their bet.

## Basic Strategy for Double Down Casino

Now that you know how to play Double Down Casino, it's important to understand some basic strategy in order to improve your chances of winning. Here are a few tips:

- Always try and match as many of your cards as possible. This increases your chances of winning, since you are essentially doubling your chances of getting a matching card.


- When doubling down, always bet your original wager amount instead of splitting it between two hands. This gives you a better chance at winning since you only have one shot at getting it right rather than two separate shots at winning two different hands.

- Remember that an Ace can be valued as either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is advantageous for the player. Use this information to your advantage when deciding whether or not to double down on a particular hand.

#  Strategies That Will Help You Win More in DFS Tournaments

There are a number of strategies that you can use in order to help increase your chances of winning in DFS tournaments. In this article, we will discuss some of the most important ones.

1. Don't Overload Your Lineup

One of the biggest mistakes that people make when building their DFS tournament lineups is loading it up with too many players. This can often lead to disastrous results, as it becomes much harder to achieve high scores when you have too many players in your lineup.

Instead, try to focus on constructing a lineup that is relatively balanced. This will allow you to have a few high-scoring players while also having some low-risk options as well. In doing so, you'll be less likely to end up with a lineup that performs poorly overall.

2. Target Players That Are Playing in Good matchups

Another key strategy for winning DFS tournaments is targeting players who are in good matchups. This means looking for players who are facing teams that are not very good defensively or who are dealing with several injuries.

By targeting these players, you can essentially give yourself a higher probability of scoring points above average. And since scoring points is the key to winning in tournaments, this is a strategy that should not be overlooked.

3. Use Value Plays In Your Lineup

Another important strategy for tournament play is using value plays in your lineup. This means finding players who are offering high upside at a lower salary level than usual. By doing so, you can free up more money to spend on the elites at other positions.

While finding value plays can be tricky, it is definitely worth the effort involved. After all, finding just one player who outperforms their salary expectations can be the difference between winning and losing in tournaments.

#  People Who Win DFS Tournaments with Strategies and People Who Win by Gambling at Double Down Casino

Despite these differences, there are some people who are successful in both settings. These “winners” have developed strategies that help them win more often than not. Here are some of the strategies that they use:

In DFS tournaments, it is important to have a well-rounded team with players from multiple positions. This helps to minimize risk and gives you a better chance of scoring points in any given matchup.
