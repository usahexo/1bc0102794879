#  Bill Gates Says Blackjack is Coming to Bo4

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Bill Gates has announced that blackjack will be coming to Xbox One in early 2019. The popular casino game will be added to the list of titles in the "Blackjack Insider" series, which is currently available on Xbox 360 and Windows 10 devices.

Gates says that the team at Microsoft has been working hard to bring blackjack to the console, and that they are excited to release it to gamers around the world. He also hinted that there may be other casino games in the works, but declined to give any further details.

Xbox One owners can look forward to playing blackjack in early 2019. The game will offer several different game modes, including classic blackjack and three-card poker. There will also be a variety of betting options available, so players can tailor the game to their liking.

#  Bill Gates Promises Blackjack for Bo4

In a recent interview with IGN, Bill Gates promised that he will create a blackjack game for Bo4 players if he is re-elected as Microsoft’s chairman. Gates has been notoriously known for making such promises in the past, most notably his promise to release Minesweeper for the Xbox 360 console.

“I am very confident that I can deliver on this promise,” said Gates in an exclusive interview with IGN. “I have already spoken to the team at Infinity Ward and they are very excited about incorporating blackjack into the game.”

Blackjack is a popular casino game that is typically played against the house. The objective of the game is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players can bet on their hand against the dealer’s hand, or they can bet on the dealer busting (going over 21).

Gates first announced his plans to develop a blackjack game for Bo4 back in 2016, but development was temporarily put on hold due to other commitments. However, with development now back underway, Gates is confident that he can have a playable version of blackjack ready in time for the game’s launch in October.

When asked about why he decided to develop a blackjack game for Bo4 instead of other popular casino games like poker or roulette, Gates had this to say:

“ Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world and I think it will be a huge hit on Bo4 . It’s a very strategic game that requires both luck and skill, and I think players will really enjoy playing it online against others. “
