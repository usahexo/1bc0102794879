#  Could it be that something is wrong with Rockin Cash Casino game Borges?

It’s been a little while since I’ve played at Rockin Cash Casino, the online casino Borges is linked with, so I decided to give it a go again the other day. Unfortunately, my experience wasn’t great and I actually lost money.

Now, I obviously can’t say for certain that there is something wrong with Rockin Cash Casino as my experience could have just been a one-off. However, I am starting to think that there might be something wrong with the games on offer there.

I have played at quite a few online casinos in my time and have never had such an unlucky run as I did at Rockin Cash Casino. In fact, I think I must have lost around $200 in the space of just a few hours!

That’s certainly not what I was hoping for and has left me feeling a little bit dubious about the whole thing. So, I thought I would share my thoughts on this with you all in case any of you are thinking of playing at Rockin Cash Casino too.

Anyway, like I said, it could just be that my experience was a one-off and things might be different for you. But, if you do decide to give Rockin Cash Casino a go, just make sure that you are aware of the risks involved and gamble responsibly.

However, there is some concern that the game may be rigged. There have been reports of players who have won thousands of dollars while playing the game only to see their wins disappear a short time later. In some cases, players have even lost money while playing the game.
