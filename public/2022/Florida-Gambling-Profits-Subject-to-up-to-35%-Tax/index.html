      		<h1 id="Florida-Gambling-Profits-Subject-to-up-to-35-Tax"><a href="#Florida-Gambling-Profits-Subject-to-up-to-35-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Florida Gambling Profits Subject to up to 35% Tax"></a>Florida Gambling Profits Subject to up to 35% Tax</h1><p>In Florida, gambling profits are subject to a tax of up to 35%. This is in addition to the regular state income tax.</p>
<p>Gambling profits are considered taxable income in Florida. This means that any money that is earned from gambling activities is subject to taxation. The tax applies to both individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>The tax rate for gambling profits in Florida is 35%. This is one of the highest tax rates in the country. However, it is still lower than the tax rate for income from other sources.</p>
<p>There are some exemptions available for gambling income. Exemptions are available for winnings that are reported on federal income taxes and for certain charitable organizations. However, most gambling profits are subject to the full 35% tax rate.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this tax applies only to gambling profits. Winnings from lotteries, horse races, and casinos are all considered taxable income. However, losses from these activities can be deducted from taxable income.</p>
<p>The gambling tax in Florida is a significant source of revenue for the state government. In fiscal year 2017, the tax generated more than $300 million in revenue. This accounted for about 2% of total state revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Casino-Tax-Revenue-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Florida-Casino-Tax-Revenue-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Florida Casino Tax Revenue on the Rise"></a>Florida Casino Tax Revenue on the Rise</h1><p>The Sunshine State is seeing a boost in casino tax revenue, with collections up more than $100 million compared to last year.</p>
<p>According to data from the Florida Department of Revenue, casino taxes totaled just over $1.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June. That’s up from about $992 million during the previous 12-month period.</p>
<p>Gambling venues across the state paid out nearly $880 million in winnings to players during the most recent fiscal year. The casinos kept about $240 million in profits.</p>
<p>The bulk of the tax revenue comes from South Florida, where there are seven casinos in operation. Broward County leads the way with nearly $600 million in taxes paid, followed by Miami-Dade County at nearly $326 million.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands was the top taxpayer among casino operators, handing over more than $138 million. That was followed by MGM Resorts at more than $118 million and Seminole Gaming at nearly $113 million. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, gaming industry representatives say they are pleased with the increase in revenue. “This is great news for our industry and for Florida’s economy as a whole,” said John Sowinski, president of No Casinos Inc., which opposes gambling expansion in Florida. </p>
<p>Taxes on casino revenues have been on the rise in Florida for several years now as the industry has grown. Collections totaled about $838 million during the 2016 fiscal year and have jumped by more than 25 percent since then. </p>
<p>The growth is being fueled largely by new casinos opening up around the state, including six that launched operations during the past two years alone. The number of casinos in Florida has grown from 18 to 27 in that time frame.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Gambling-Revenue-Tops-2B-in-2017"><a href="#Florida-Gambling-Revenue-Tops-2B-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Florida Gambling Revenue Tops $2B in 2017"></a>Florida Gambling Revenue Tops $2B in 2017</h1><p>Florida gambling revenue topped $2B in 2017, with casinos and racinos combined taking in a record $2.03B. This was a 6.5% increase over 2016’s revenue of $1.9B, and was driven largely by the expansion of casino gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Casinos accounted for the majority of the revenue growth, with their take increasing by nearly 10% to $1.37B. This increase was due largely to the opening of new casinos in South Florida, as well as continued growth in tourism to the state. Racinos (horse racing tracks with attached casinos) also saw their revenue grow, albeit more modestly at just 2%.</p>
<p>Not all forms of gambling saw increases, however; lottery ticket sales were down 3% from 2016 levels. This drop was likely due to more Floridians choosing to gamble at casinos and racinos, which offer a wider variety of games than the lottery does.</p>
<p>The good news for gambling advocates is that this growth is likely to continue in 2018, as new casinos are set to open in both Miami and Orlando. These new venues are expected to add another $300M or so to Florida’s gambling revenues. This will make Florida one of the largest gambling markets in the country – a distinction currently held by Nevada – and is sure to attract even more tourists to the Sunshine State.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Plans-to-Tax-Gambling-Winnings-over-600"><a href="#Florida-Plans-to-Tax-Gambling-Winnings-over-600" class="headerlink" title="Florida Plans to Tax Gambling Winnings over $600"></a>Florida Plans to Tax Gambling Winnings over $600</h1><p>Florida may soon be taxing gambling winnings over $600 as the state looks to generate additional revenue. The proposed tax would apply to both residents and non-residents of Florida, and is expected to generate around $13 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Under the proposed tax, individuals would be taxed at a rate of 5.5%. Gambling companies would also be required to pay the tax on winnings paid out to their customers. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it will drive gamblers away from Florida casinos, while others maintain that the tax is necessary in order to help offset the state’s budget deficit.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Florida has considered imposing a tax on gambling winnings. A previous proposal, which would have taxed winnings over $500, was abandoned earlier this year after facing opposition from lawmakers.</p>
<p>The proposed tax comes as Florida faces a budget shortfall of $1 billion. Lawmakers are currently considering a range of options for closing the deficit, including cuts to education and health care funding, as well as increasing taxes and fees.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Slots-Tables-and-Sports-Betting-All-Subject-to-Taxes"><a href="#Florida-Slots-Tables-and-Sports-Betting-All-Subject-to-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Florida Slots, Tables, and Sports Betting All Subject to Taxes"></a>Florida Slots, Tables, and Sports Betting All Subject to Taxes</h1><p>In March of this year, the Florida legislature approved a bill that imposes a new 6% tax on slot machines, table games, and sports betting. The tax is expected to generate $120 million in revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Slot machines will be taxed at a rate of 5%, while table games and sports betting will be taxed at a rate of 7%. The tax will be applied at the point of sale, meaning casinos and other gaming establishments will need to collect it from customers.</p>
<p>The bill had broad bipartisan support in the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis. It goes into effect on July 1, 2019.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Florida has imposed a tax on casino gambling. A previous 6% tax was enacted in 2009 but was later repealed.</p>
<p>Supporters of the new tax say it is needed to help cover the costs of providing public services such as education and healthcare. They also argue that it will help level the playing field between casinos and racetracks, which have been exempt from taxation in the past.</p>
<p>Opponents of the tax say it will drive business out of Florida and cost jobs. They also argue that it is unfair to apply a higher tax rate to casinos than to other forms of gambling such as lotteries and horse racing.</p>
